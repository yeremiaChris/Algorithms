# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes the series of connected node
Each node constist of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node
The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity
The linked list data structure supports three main operations

1. Insertion - to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the list
2. Deletion - to remove an item given index or value
3. Search - to find an element given its value
