# Recursion

## What

Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
Recursion is when a function calls it self

## Why

A great technique to simplify your solution
If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very usefull

# A few points about recursion

Every recursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion.
Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.

Recurision is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand. Do not give up if you struggle with the concept.
